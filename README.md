# Web Application 

This project can be used to run a basic [flask app with MySQL as DB]- BACKEND and VUE.js - [FRONTEND]  using docker-compose.


# Description
The "Table" view I see a table with football clubs, sorted by points.
In the "Admin" view I have the possibility to enter a result:
Two clubs can be selected and one can be marked as winner. Each victory is worth three points. If no winner is marked, the match is considered a draw and both teams get one point. Goals are not counted.
